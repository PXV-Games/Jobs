Every time a new game is created, all Job positions will be created and assigned to a randomized created NPC Player.
Once the game begins, at the end of every shift, the NPC will update himself, with:
  - The amount of money earned
  - The experience obtained at work
  - The effort applied (randomly after every shift)
  - If the requirements are met, the NPC will keep the job, if not, the possibility of getting fired will increase at a 5% per day.
  - If the NPC is fired, it will be on a state of -Jobless- for a period of 3 days and randomly will occupy the next empty job if the player is not applying for it too.
  - If the player is applying for a job, he will compete against the other Applicant NPCs for the position.
  - The NPC or in the case of the Player, with better possibilities, will obtain the job.
  
Job application and Interviews:
  - After applying for a Job, the Player or the NPCs will have to do an Interview imediately the next day to obtain the position.
  - Depending on the requirements and the level of the Abilities/Skills or the Traits, the probabilites of getting the job will be higher.
  - With a system of points, the NPC/PC, with more points will obtain the position.
  
Jobs will be payed allways by hours worked. 
By the enf of the week (allways on Fridays), depending on the effort of the NPC/PC, there's a possibility of a Bonus, payment increase, decrease or getting fired. 
There will be random events during working hours, that will make the player take decisions that will affect possitively or negatively the position.
There will be an Event, that will either make the player work more hours (paid) or less hours (paid).

Vacations:
Every week the player will obtain 1 vacation day (not paid). These are accumulable and the player will decide when to take them, allways asking in advance, 
that way the company will have time to replace the player.

Jobs and positions without worker:
These jobs will automatically be filled with "Substitute" NPCs that in case of not having contact with the player, will be deleted after the Job.
In case of contact, the Substitute will automatically be created as a NPC, and will be added to the game.
